# MicroBag-Project

It has been my desire to produce solutions to problems using free tools that is accessible to mankind in respective of it's nature. MicroBag is what I envision to be a component of many components just like a system with different systems.
I am building a long term history of a product that will seek to address problems in the field of Information Technology.
As student and someone who is interested in finding the easiest way out of life, it has become a necessity to develop myself to the point building system is what i will enjoy doing.

#### AND I HOPE I DEDICATE MY LIFE TO THIS COURSE OF ACTION.
