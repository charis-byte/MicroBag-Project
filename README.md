# MicroBag-Project

It has been my desire to produce solutions to problems using free tools that is accessible to mankind in respective of it's nature. MicroBag is what I envision to be a component of many components just like a system with different systems that seeks to help internet users make the most out of their time irrespective of where they are, what they do and how they choose to use what is at their disposal.
I am building a long term history of a product that will seek to address problems in the field of Information Technology.
This Project will have Project management implementation that will enable me to be able to learn and systematically apply the techniques to other projects as well. 


 





#### AND I HOPE I DEDICATE MY LIFE TO THIS COURSE OF ACTION.
